        <div class="text-muted pr-4">
          We are a Not-for-Profit team that is aiming for quality education across the country. 
          Our platform finds tutors for the community children to study in small localised groups at 
          subsidised fees that have been agreed upon by the teachers and the parents of the grouped children.
          <br><br>
          Ever since the COVID-19 education lockdown, our children have been seated home and 
          are wearing away academically, and with the recently increased school lockdown for lower primary, 
          we believe home schooling is a viable option to keep the children occupied academically.
          <br><br>
          Our job is to create study-groups and add children or students according to their proximity and then 
          match them with a willing and qualified teacher.

            HomeSchool brings the best parts of education to your home with 
            willing teachers, small class sizes, and a personalized curriculum.
            Children in the same neighbourhood and classes can study together for 
            3 - 4 hours a day. Your children receive an enriching experience with 
            greater flexibility and more personalized attention than the traditional 
            schools can offer - all in a safe and inspiring home learning environment. 
            HomeSchool does not intend to replace the existing education framework it is 
            only expected to run until schools are fully open to all classes. 
            We just want our children to study, even in COVID!
