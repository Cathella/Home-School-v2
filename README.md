# Home School.
- Due to the increasing covid19 crisis currently in our country today, I considered working on a practical project solution that is related to our education crisis at present. 
- I got the project inspiration from Schoolhouse but I am going to fully customise it into a version that works for us locally.

## Project Features
- A parent or child registers to be grouped in a study-group with other like students in the neighborhood.
- A teacher can register to be matched with a created study-group near them.
- The logic of the project is to match teachers and students to join study groups in nearby locations of less than 500 meters. This is achieved using the google maps places API and using the haversine formula to calculate the distance between each location.

## Technologies
- Ruby on Rails
