# Home School.
- Due to the increasing covid19 crisis currently in our country today, I considered working on a practical project solution that is related to our education crisis at present. 
- I got the project inspiration from Schoolhouse but I am going to fully customise it into a version that works for us locally.

## Project's features to include
It is mainly registration of three different entities:
- A parent or child registers to be grouped in a study-group with other like students in the neighborhood.
- A teacher can register to be matched with a created study-group near them.
- The logic of the project is to match teachers and students to join study groups in nearby locations of less than 500 meters.

## Technologies
- Ruby on Rails
